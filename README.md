###Ultimate Audio Player

We are working on programming the Ultimate Audio Player in Swift. 

Work on a very basic audio player has begun. Current objectives are: 

- Implement the full array of control buttons: Play/Pause, FF, Rew, Next, Previous  
- Implement gestures to work with control functions  
- Add license free icons for the controls: Switch between play and pause icon when playing  
- Create an architecture for the player


Our longterm goal for this project include these features:

- Support for Music, Books and Podcasts  
- Play from the Cloud, iOS (iTunes) and App storage  
- Clearly Display title, artist, artwork and other meta data  
- Support for a dark mode for nighttime  
- Control playback using gestures  
- Watch controls  
- Auto bookmarking on long files  
- Cloud meta storage  
- Download from the web and RSS feeds


New attendees are welcome. Having an understanding of object oriented concepts helps, but is not required.

If you plan to attend, but later can't make it, please update your RSVP.

We are now two blocks from the McLean metro stop on the Silver line. We meet at TeqCorner in McLean, VA on some Mondays at 7:00 PM. Please check the Meetup site to confirm the meeting. 

The Swift documentation is available through Apple's iBooks store or online:

We have not standardized on any Swift book yet, however we have been using Ray Wenderlich's excellent tutorials at raywenderlich.com.
